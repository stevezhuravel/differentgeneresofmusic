        <h5><p>Jazz was born in New Orleans in the late 19th – early 20th century, but its roots come from musical traditions of Africa and Europe.
          Jazz was born out of and evolved through the African American experience in the United States. This genre evolved from slave songs and spirituals – religious African American folk songs.
          Jazz is the ultimate result of technical and sonic advancements to the blues and ragtime styles of music that culminated the early 20th century, most notably among African American communities in the United States. 
           Jazz is a type of music of Black American culture characterized by improvisation, sanction, and a fast rhythm. It became very well known at the beginning of the 20th century.
          According to “African-Derived Music of the Americas” by Verna B “The Jazz musical genres all share the same roots coming from west Africa.”
