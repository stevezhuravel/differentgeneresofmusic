                <h5><p>Gospel music originated in the late 1800s, from the African-American church.
                  Many churches in the southern United States begin to fuse together different type of musical songs in there church services including spirituals, hymns and sacred music
                  Gospel music is a genre of Christian music that came into play during the 19th century that diverged into different paths within the white and black communities. 
                  Gospel music can be performed for different purposes such as for  aesthetics,ceremonial, and for entertainment. But, it is mainly performed religiously. It consists of the music element of call and response, where the lead singer would sing first, and the rest of the choir would sing back, usually a repeated chorus. This is similar to a conversation between the preacher and the congregation. The choirs in gospel music are usually large in which there are a variety of voices and harmonies such as soprano, alto, bass, and tenor.
